This is a little project that I created to practice using Retrofit and Coil libraries in Jetpack Compose, as well as structuring and testing an Android project to be maintainable.
You can search for books available on Google's servers and see some details about them.
The application also uses Room library to be able to save the books locally.
Later on, I added some useful UI features as well, so you are able to filter the search results by author and language, and select multiple items on the saved screen.
